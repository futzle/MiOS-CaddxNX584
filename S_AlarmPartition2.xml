         them to the UPnP consumer.

    <!-- The Detailed state of the Partition, representing whether it's Armed, Disarmed or one
         of the common intermediary states.

         Partition implementations are required to implement the "Armed" and "Disarmed" states,
         corresponding to the State variable above.  Not every Panel provides the required API
         to "see" the other statuses and reflect them to the UPnP consumer.

         Note that some implementations may consider the "ExitDelay" state to be "Armed"
         whilst others may consider them to be "Disarmed".  No association between DetailedArmMode
         and State variables should be assumed by UPnP clients, due to this potential difference.

         Some of the states may be transitional, and no guarantees are provided that the Panel
         will complete any subsequent transition to a corresponding permanent state.  
         UPnP clients should make no assumptions about the "next state" from what is
         immediately presented, since this may be Vendor and/or Implementation specific.

         Some of the states, like Night/NightInstant and Vacation, are included for specific Panel
         vendors like the Elk and may not be present on other Panels.  Control Point authors should
         be prepared to display these DetailedArmMode using an CP-specific visualization (an Icon,
         Translated Text and so-on)

         Disarmed - The Partition is disarmed.
         Armed - The Partition is currently armed, or in an "away" state.
         Stay - The Partition is in an "at-home" state, delays are permitted on Entry doors.
         StayInstant - The Partition is in an "at-home" state, Entry doors trigger Alarm immediately.
         Night - The Partition is in an "at-home, at-night" state, delays are permitted on Entry doors.
         NightInstant - The Partition is in an "at-home, at-night" state, Entry doors trigger Alarm immediately.
         Force - The Partition is in an "away" state, but one or more Zones are open.
         Ready - The Partition is in an un-armed state, and ready to be Armed.
         Vacation - The Partition is currently armed, or in an "away" state.
         NotReady - The Partition is in an un-armed state, but one or more Zones are open.
         FailedToArm - The Partition is in an un-armed state, and an arming attempt just failed.
         EntryDelay - The Partition is currently moving towards the Disarmed state.
         ExitDelay - The Partition is currently moving towards the Armed state.

    <!-- An indicator of whether the Partition is in Alarm state or not.

      Partition implementations are only required to implement the "None" and "Active"
      states.

      Many alarm systems will "automatically" clear a Alarm state after some, often legally
      mandated, period of time.  If this happens, the Partition should move to the "None"
      state, but also has the option of setting the "AlarmMemory" state.

      None - The Partition is not currently in Alarm, and no prior record of Alarm.
      Active - The Partition is currently showing as an Alarm actively going off.

    <!-- An indicator of whether the Partition has Chime mode enabled.

      Some Alarm Systems (DSC, Paradox, GE Caddx) can run in a mode where each Zone
      that's opened will trigger a Chime, or Bell, to ring for a short period of
      time.  This setting is independant of any Armed or Disarmed state of the 
      Partition.

      If the Panel supports intraspection of this property, then the value should
      be brought forward.  Some panels (Paradox) support the setting, but don't
      support the intraspection of the setting.  In these cases, the Partition
      implementation must return "false" for this attribute.

      true - The Partition is in Chime mode, and will ring a Bell when Zones are opened.
      false - Chimes are disabled.  No chime/sound will occur when a Zone is opened.

      false - No prior Alarm state is known, or the Prior Alarm condition has been cleared.

      value for this StateVariable.

      0 - Default value if "Memory" is not supported, or if no prior record of Alarm.

      by UPnP Clients to display "progress" or current state.

      These can also be used by "events" to provide Partition-specific mechanisms to
      trigger things like "Fail to Arm" events and the like.

      eg. "1378" (Elk) - "Rule Triggered Voice Telephone Dial"
      eg. "658" (DSC) - "Keypad Lock-out"
